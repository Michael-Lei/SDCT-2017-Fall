## This is the folder for ANTLR

### Contents

- Main file is "Arithmetic.g4", which is the grammar file.
- All the other files are automatically generated by ANTLR4, you can see files names including "tokens", "context"â€¦ which indicates that ANTLR works just like what we have learned from the book. 

### Function

Here is a sample program for parsing arithmetic expressions. I think it is pretty much the same thing as parsing a program (program can be far more complicated but the main idea is just the same). You can find some tutorial online to run this ANTLR program, basically you can see a tree map after input an arithmetic expression.
