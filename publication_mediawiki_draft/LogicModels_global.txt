Preface 

focus on the publication itself instead of the documentation

should introduce why we write this publication, and why it's necessary to divide the system into so many levels to run codes as simple as "hello world"

backgroud: 
    Some readers have background in specific levels, some do not. Written for those who have no background at all
    Focus not only the implementation itself, but also the computational thinking
    When doing homework, we find where it can be improved. 
    Emphasize design by contract, and groupword using git and wiki
    It is a challege for those who had no background before.

Goal:
    Learn computational thinking, rather than do 12 assignments only
    After reading all course videos, textbook and our publication, and finishing homework, any reader should be able to deal with coplex systems in computational thinking. (particularly Staging, Modularity, Abstraction, Focus)

Validation:
    Is it possible for a reader who has no background to understand computational thinking after reading our publication? 

input: 
    textbook
    Nand2Tetris course website

output:
    a publication
    a git repo with slides and source codes for homework



Spotlights:
    optimization of assembly codes
    implement the game Go in Jack and its three rules
    a Jack compiler written in Java
